# Fungal-Bolt-Scripting-3-Fixed-Shooter-Assignment-
Solo Fixed Shooter assignment for Scripting 3 class.

A and D to move left and right. The player's ship is locked on the X axis.

Spacebar to shoot. 

The game has three main levels, each with a new enemy, the third one incorporating a multi-phased boss battle.
You have infinite lives, as the goal is not survival as much as it is a challenge to see how few player deaths you end the game with.
The game should take between 1 and 2 minutes to play through.

All visuals are made by myself usin Aseprite, with the exception of me having help with the rock BG from a friend.
Music and Sound does not belong to me. I did incorporate the sound design and worked on sound editing.

Music - Touhou
SFX - Minecraft, Halo, Your Turn To Die, Celeste
